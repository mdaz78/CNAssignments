2. Write a program to determine whether the entered character is in uppercase or lowercase, or is an invalid character.
   
   Print 1 for uppercase
  
  Print 0 for lowercase
  
  Print -1 for any other character
   
   Input format : single character
  
  Output format : 1 or 0 or -1

3. Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic and the grade and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -

   t_sal = basic + hra + da + allow â€“ pf, where
   
  hra = 20% of basic

  da = 50% of basic

  allow = 1700 if grade = 'A'

  allow = 1500 if grade = 'B'

  allow = 1300 if grade = 'C' or any other character

  pf = 11% of basic

  Round of the total salary and then print the integral part only.

   Input format : Basic and grade (seperated by space)

4. Write a program to calculate the roots of a given quadratic equation -
   a(x^2) + bx + c = 0

   Print roots specifying their nature. If roots are imaginary, no need to print the roots.

   Print the nature of roots in the form of an integer - 
   
  0 : if roots are real and same

  1 : if roots are real and different

  -1 : if roots are imaginary


   Round of the roots and then print the integral part only i.e. without any decimal places.

   You can assume that, input will always be a quadratic equation.

   Input format : a b c (separated by space)

   Output format :  
  
  Line 1 : Nature of roots (0 or 1 or -1)

  Line 2 : Root 1 and Root 2 (separated by space)

5.  Write a program to input a number and print the sum of all it's even digits and sum of all its odd digits separately.

   Digits means, numbers not the places. That is, if a number is "13245", even digits are 2 & 4 and odd digits are 1, 3 & 5.
   
   Input format : An integer
   
  Output format : SumOfEvenDigits SumOfOddDigits
   
  (Print first even sum and then odd sum separated by space)
   
   Sample Inout : 1234
  Sample output : 6 4

6. Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.

   Input format :
  
  Line 1 : x

  Line 2 : n

   Sample Input 1:
  
  3

  4

   Sample output 2:

  81
