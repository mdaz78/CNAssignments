2. Write a program to determine whether the entered character is in uppercase or lowercase, or is an invalid character.
   
   Print 1 for uppercase
  
  Print 0 for lowercase
  
  Print -1 for any other character
   
   Input format : single character
  
  Output format : 1 or 0 or -1

3. Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic and the grade and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -

   t_sal = basic + hra + da + allow â€“ pf, where
   
  hra = 20% of basic

  da = 50% of basic

  allow = 1700 if grade = 'A'

  allow = 1500 if grade = 'B'

  allow = 1300 if grade = 'C' or any other character

  pf = 11% of basic

  Round of the total salary and then print the integral part only.

   Input format : Basic and grade (seperated by space)

4. Write a program to calculate the roots of a given quadratic equation -
   a(x^2) + bx + c = 0

   Print roots specifying their nature. If roots are imaginary, no need to print the roots.

   Print the nature of roots in the form of an integer - 
   
  0 : if roots are real and same

  1 : if roots are real and different

  -1 : if roots are imaginary


   Round of the roots and then print the integral part only i.e. without any decimal places.

   You can assume that, input will always be a quadratic equation.

   Input format : a b c (separated by space)

   Output format :  
  
  Line 1 : Nature of roots (0 or 1 or -1)

  Line 2 : Root 1 and Root 2 (separated by space)
